# TeamHackathon

Hello! We are a team of 3 participating in this hackathon.

Our aim in this hackathon is to digitalize the hospital data so that the doctor can have knowledge about the patients previous visits and also 
to know about their previous diagnosis and prescriptions 


We have created a web application using:  
    HTML,
    CSS,
    JAVASCRIPT,
    PHP
 
  And we have implemented an AI chatbot, which collects user data and sends to the Hospital server for Digital medical records maintenance.
  The chatbot is done using python and integrated with the web application using Streamlit.
  
  In order to improve the security for our web application we have used md5 hashing method to securely store the password attribute in the
  hospital database.
